## Thought
+ Input feature is $256d \times H \times W$ after convolution from origin image, use kernel like $3 \times 3 \times 256$.
+ For each pixel, prepare 3 scale x 3 type anchors, just like 3 different Size and (1:1, 1:2, 2:1) total 9 anchors, we assign positive tag and negetive tag to each anchors, so we have $9 \times 2$ total 18 dimension.
+ Cause too many anchors is a burdon,so finally we choose 128 positive sample and 128 negetive.
+ For each point $1 \times 1 \times 256$ do a full connect to get 2 socore(foreground and backgroud) and 4 coordinates.
