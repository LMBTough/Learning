# Dual Shot Face Detector
## Preview
+ A novel Feature Enhance Module to utilize different level information and thus obtain more discriminability and robustness features. 
+ Auxiliary supervisions introduced in early layers via aset of smaller anchors to effectively facilitate the features. 
+ An improved anchor matching strategy to match an-
chors and ground truth faces as far as possible to provide better initialization for the regressor. 
+ Comprehensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks FDDB and WIDER FACE to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DSFD network compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
